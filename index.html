    <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is an effective coding procedure that ensures that users from all devices and browsers, old and new, can run websites. In a concise explanation, the website developers write the code that functions on
      older devices and browsers. After ensuring the code is functional on these devices, the website developers can then add more features on top of the code for newer devices and browsers that support it. These website developers
      implement progressive enhancment by creating a basic foundation of assessable code that can be run by many different browsers and devices to ascertain that everyone can access the website, and only then, adding more features, that
      new browesers and devices can support so that the website looks modern and trustworthy while being assessable. One can only begin to enhance the website once you have determined it has been built for all.
