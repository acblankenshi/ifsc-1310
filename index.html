    <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is an effective coding procedure that ensures that users from all devices and browsers, old and new, can run websites. In a concise explanation, the website developers write the code that functions on
      older devices and browsers. After ensuring the code is functional on these devices, the website developers can then add more features on top of the code for newer devices and browsers that support it. These website developers
      implement progressive enhancment by creating a basic foundation of assessable code that can be run by many different browsers and devices to ascertain that everyone can access the website, and only then, adding more features, that
      new browesers and devices can support so that the website looks modern and trustworthy while being assessable. One can only begin to enhance the website once you have determined it has been built for all.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://recordssoundthesame.com/blog/2017/01/27/a-practical-guide-to-pwas/">Here</a> is an article that helps describe what Progressive Enhancement is and how to implement it.
    The website states that one must plan their approach, considering what you need to ensure works, and to think about your audience.</p>

    <h1>DRAGON PROJECT REVISION AND REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT</h1>
    <p>Entering the class at the beginning of the semester knowing nothing about HTML, CSS, or JS, I feel confident to say that I have overcome many learning obstacles this semester during the course. Thankfully, the three coding languages all have basic
      written semantics so that learning the language was not very challenging. The curve ball I was thrown and force to hit, however, stems from trying to connect the three langauges fluidly. So many times, I accidentaly targeted a parent class rather than
      it's child class, broken my code with css, or spent so much time looking for a small error. With three languages that affect one another, I found it difficult to be precise and would get lost while coding; however, over this semester, I have
      definetly become more accurate with my coding.</p>

      <p>This Dragon Project actually helped me to overcome those obstacles. I was able to familiarize myself with JS and could quickly write basic styling for my text and links. I was faced with challenges about positioning my images correctly and
      creating a uniform navigation bar, however, that helped to develop my understanding of the code and how elements affected one another. Even though I developed my skills, it is still clear I had much more to improve.</p>

      <p>I asked a classmate for advice to revise my Dragon Project and my CSS skills were clearly lacking. He enjoyed my Dark mode and Light mode, but critiqued select choices of design: my home and faq page. He proposed that I added
      an image behind some text on my home page to make the page more professional as well as adding JS to my faq page to make the questions interactive. I personally agreed and addressed these two areas, much quicker than I could have at the beginning
      of the semester.</p>

      <p>It is clear after completing this project that I have grown as a developer in many ways. I have been pushed to keep consistent syntax in my code for good coding practices, developed my critical thinking to approach problems, and
      learned how to connect HTML, CSS, and JS to create an experience that the consumer would enjoy (though I am years away from achieving that).</p>
